# Parity-Sims
Studying the behavior of superconducting qubits by consdering the quasiparticle QP density in the qubit island and junction.
Similar to QDR
QP density vs time is calculated, QP tunneling rate is also calculated using the QP density. QP tunneling events that result in no state change, that result in qubit energy decay, and excitation are generated as poisson processes using their calculated rates. Similarly, other qubit processes such as non-QP related qubit energy decay, excitation and dephasing are also generated according to input rates.
